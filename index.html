        Hey, I'm Amy! I enjoy programming, logical thinking (looking at you, Hashi),
        listening to and playing music, and meeting new people (and much more of course).

        I'm just messing around with Git at the moment in my spare time during the holidays
        to get my head around it a bit better as I know it is a vital skill for the industry,
        and I'm having a lot of fun! Having said that I know this site wasn't made by me, I am
        using a Summer of Tech template, so next step might be to revise my HTML, CSS and JavaScript!
